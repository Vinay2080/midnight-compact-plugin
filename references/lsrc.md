# Introduction

This file gives a formal specification of well-formedness of term-level objects (such expressions) in Compact. It is a
literate Agda file, and thus can be type-checked to verify that the defintions are correct.

The specification uses no known unsafe features of Agda.

**TODO: safe temporarily gone bc type-level spec is unsafe**

First, we ought to make sure the following modules are imported. There are many other imports, but most of these are
from Agda's standard library and merely used for structuring the specification.

-- objects in Compact.
open import Semantics.Static.Lsrc.Lsrc-Typing

-- Contains the abstract syntax of Compact, as it's defined and used
-- internally in the compiler.
open import Syntax.Generated.Lsrc

-- Imports tooling to statically enforce coverage of typing relations.
open import Semantics.Static.Coverage

--
open import Class.MonotonePredicate

```

toℕ : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} {x : A} {xs} → x ∈ xs → ℕ
toℕ (here refl) = 0
toℕ (there px)  = suc (toℕ px)

```
--> 

# Preliminary definitions

We start by giving a precise description of the contextual information and auxiliary definitions under which term-level
ojects in Compact are typed. The context is used to make sure that information such as declared variables or types is
available when describing well-formedness of terms. It also allows us to describe how contextual information changes,
for example before and after a struct or enum is declared.

## Type Context Extension

The following operation denotes extension of type contexts with a list of newly bound type variables.

```agda
_⋊_  : List Type-Param → TypeContext → TypeContext
v∗ ⋊ Δ = [ Δ v↦ v∗ ++ Δ .variables ]
```

We should read `v∗ ⋊ Δ` as `Δ` extended with type variables `v∗`.

```agda
subst-⋊
  : ∀ v∗
  → SubstitutionT [ Δ v↦ v∗ ] (Δ .variables)
  → SubstitutionT (v∗ ⋊ Δ) (Δ .variables)
subst-⋊ {Δ} v∗ σ x = ⊎[ σ , cvar ] (∈-++⁻ _ x)
  where
    cvar
      : type-param ∈ Δ .variables
      → param[ (λ _ → ∃[ n ]    Δ ⊢tsize n)
             , (λ _ → ∃[ type ] Δ ⊢type type)
             ] type-param
    cvar {nat-valued name} x
      = type-size-ref name , ⊢tsize-type-size-ref x
    cvar {type-valued name} x
      = (`tref (type-ref name []))
      , ⊢type-tref (⊢tref-type-ref (var (x , refl)) [])


⋊[_] : ∀ {v∗} → SubstitutionT [ Δ v↦ v∗ ] (Δ .variables) → ⊢Type (v∗ ⋊ Δ) → ⊢Type Δ  
⋊[ σ ] τ = substT (subst-⋊ _ σ) τ

⋊[_]∗ : ∀ {v∗} → SubstitutionT [ Δ v↦ v∗ ] (Δ .variables) → List (⊢Type (v∗ ⋊ Δ)) → List (⊢Type Δ)
⋊[ σ ]∗ = lmap ⋊[ σ ]
```

```agda

```

## Callable Objects

_Callable objects_ are the function-like objects in Compact: circuits, witnesses, etectera. An object `Callable Δ`
describes the type of a function under type context `Δ`, and consists of three parts.

1. `params`, describing the type parameters of the callable, carrying for each type-parameter a proof that it is
   well-formed.

2. `returns`, describing the type returned by the callable, together with a proof that it's well-formed.

3. `pargs`, describing the pattern arguments of the callable, together with proofs that their types are well-formed.
   Crucially, the types of a callable's arguments are typed with respect to type context `Δ` _extended with the type
   parameters bound by the callable_.

```agda 
record Callable (Δ : TypeContext) : Set where
  constructor callable
  field
    params
      : ∃[ xs ]
          ∀ x → x ∈ xs
              → Δ ⊢type-param x  
    returns
      : ⊢Type (params .proj₁ ⋊ Δ)
      
    args
      : List (⊢Type (params .proj₁ ⋊ Δ))

mono : ⊢Type Δ → List (⊢Type Δ) → Callable Δ
mono τ τ∗ .Callable.params = [] , λ _ ()
mono τ τ∗ .Callable.returns = τ
mono τ τ∗ .Callable.args = τ∗

```

We use `𝓌`, `ω`, and `κ` to range over callable objects (respectively, witnesses, circuits, and un-specified).

<!--
```agda 
open Callable public
```

```agda
variable
  κ κ₁ κ₂ κ₃ κ′
    : Callable Δ
  𝓌 𝓌₁ 𝓌₂ 𝓌₃ 𝓌′
    : Callable Δ
  ω ω₁ ω₂ ω₃ ω′
    : Callable Δ 
```
--> 

## Contexts

Contexts store the contextual information needed to describe well-formedness of term-level objects in Compact.

We define the following alias to describe variable bindings with well formed types, simply by having a finite mapping
from names to a tuple consisting of a type and a proof that it is well-formed under `Δ`.

There

1. definitions of user-defined types, such as structs and enums,

2. declared witnesses that are in scope,

3. declared circuits that are in scope,

4. available kernel operations, i.e., ADT operations and operations that interact with the ZSwap ledger,

5. external contracts that the contract may interact with, and

6. variables bound by `const` expressions or in a circuit header.

To simplify the definition of the typing rules at least somewhat, we'll require as much as possible that this contextual
information is well-formed wherever applicable.

### Variables

Sets of bound variables are represented by a finite mapping between names and a tuple of a type and a proof that it is
well-formed under type context `Δ`.

```agda 
Variables
  : TypeContext
  → Set
Variables Δ
  = Name ↦ ⊢Type Δ 


rename-vars
  : ∀ {vs us}
  → Renaming (Δ .variables) vs
  → Renaming (Δ .userTypes) us
  → Variables Δ → Variables [ Δ ↦ us ∣ vs ]
rename-vars ρv ρu [] = []
rename-vars ρv ρu ((name , t) ∷ vs) = (name , renameT ρv ρu t) ∷ rename-vars ρv ρu vs

rename-map
  : ∀ {K vs us} {P : TypeContext → Set}
  → ⦃ RenameT P ⦄
  → Renaming (Δ .variables) vs
  → Renaming (Δ .userTypes) us
  → K ↦ P Δ → K ↦ P [ Δ ↦ us ∣ vs ]
rename-map ρv ρu [] = []
rename-map ρv ρu ((k , v) ∷ xs) = (k , renameT ρv ρu v) ∷ rename-map ρv ρu xs

variable v∗ v∗₁ v∗₂ v∗′ : Variables Δ 
```

### Kernel Operations

Kernel operations (i.e., that interact with the ZSwap ledger or ledger ADTs) are given by a `Callable` object (which
itself stores well-formedness proofs about the signature). For ADT operations, to retrieve the callable (s) of a given
ADT we must supply a proof that it is a declared ledger type in `Δ`.

Along with the callables corresponding with the operations on that ADT, we get a proof that the type parameters of the
ADT match the type parameters of the returned callable. For instance, the `insert`
function of the `Set` ADT is returned as a generic circuit with one type parameter corresponding to the type of values
stored in the set.

```agda
record Kernel (Δ : TypeContext) : Set where
  field
    kernel
      : Name ↦ Callable Δ
    adt-ops
      : ∀ adt → adt ∈ Δ .ledgerTypes
              → Name ↦
                  Σ[ κ ∈ Callable Δ ] κ .params .proj₁ ≡ adt .proj₂
```

<!-- 
```agda 
open Kernel public
```
--> 

### User-Defined Types

Which information we need to store for a user-defined type depends on whether it is a structure or an enum.

```agda 
Usertype
  : TypeContext
  → Decl
  → Set
Usertype Δ enum
  = List  String
Usertype Δ (struct type-param∗)
  = Variables (type-param∗ ⋊ Δ) 
```

For enums, we keep a list of names, describing the elements in the enum. For structs, we keep a set of variables,
storing the names and types of the fields of the struct. The fields of a struct should be well-formed with respect to
the surrounding type context `Δ` extended with the generic type parameters of the struct, since their types may refer to
type variables bound in the structs header.

We define the following structure for storing a collection of user-defined types. User types are typed with respect to
the global type context to ensure that structure fields can refer to e.g. ledger ADTs. While the definition of `UTypes`
permits cyclic dependencies in theory, in practice they cannot arise because the context of user-declared types is
constructed in a sequential manner, and there is no typing rule that allows the definition of a struct whose field types
include a forward reference.

```agda 
data UTypes (Δ : TypeContext)
  : (u : Name ↦ Decl) → Set where
  
  ∅
    : UTypes Δ []

  _∷_
    : ∀ {u}
    → Usertype Δ d
    → UTypes Δ u
    → UTypes Δ ((name , d) ∷ u)
```

**TODO: do we want to witness the inability to create forward references constructively in the defintion of UTypes?**.

The set of user types under a type context `Δ` is given by a
`Usertype` for each declared type in `Δ`.

```agda 
Usertypes
  : TypeContext
  → Set
Usertypes Δ
  = UTypes Δ (Δ .userTypes)
```

Finally, we define the following operation that retreives the set of fields associated with a declared structure type.

```
fields
  : ∀ u
  → (name , (struct type-param∗)) ∈ u
  → UTypes Δ u
  → Variables (type-param∗ ⋊ Δ)
fields (_ ∷ _) (here refl) (field∗ ∷ _)
  = field∗
fields (_ ∷ _) (there px) (x ∷ U)
  = fields _ px U

```

### Contexts

To bundle all the different kinds of contextual information, we define contexts as a predicate over type contexts. This
allows us to witness, at the type level, that a context is typed with respect to a particular type context. This
happens, for example, when sequencing statements, in which case the context may change following a `const`
declaration, but the type context will remain the same.

```agda

record Env (Δ : TypeContext) : Set where
  constructor <<_,_,_,_,_,_>>  
  field
    utypes    : Usertypes Δ
    witnesses : Name ↦ Callable Δ 
    circuits  : Name ↦ Callable Δ
    builtin   : Kernel Δ 
    ext       : Name ↦ (Name ↦ Callable Δ)
    ledger    : Name ↦ LedgerType Δ 

open Env public 

variable nv : Env Δ 

Env′ = ∃ Env

variable η η₁ η₂ η₃ η′ : Env′  

record IsContext (Δ : TypeContext) : Set where
  constructor context 
  field
    env  : Env Δ
    vars : Variables Δ
```

<!-- 
```agda 
open IsContext public
```
-->

In other scenarios it is useful to bundle contexts with their type context, in which case we use the following alias for
the existential closure of the `IsContext` predicate.

```agda 
Context = ∃ IsContext 
```

### Empty Contexts

```agda 
εΓ[_·_] : (l∗ : Name ↦ List Type-Param) → (κ : Kernel εΔ[ l∗ ]) → Context
εΓ[ l∗ · κ ] = εΔ[ l∗ ]  , context << ∅ , [] , [] , κ , [] , [] >> [] 
```

We use the following projections to project respectively the type level and term level contextual information from a
bundled context.

```agda 
Δ⟨_⟩
  : Context
  → TypeContext
Δ⟨_⟩
  = proj₁

Δ[_] : Env′ → TypeContext
Δ[_] = proj₁

nv[_] : (η : Env′) → Env Δ[ η ]
nv[_] = proj₂ 

𝓒⟨_⟩
  : (Γ : Context)
  → IsContext Δ⟨ Γ ⟩
𝓒⟨_⟩
  = proj₂

η⟨_⟩ : Context → Env′
η⟨ Γ ⟩ = Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ , 𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩ .env 

```

```agda
<_↦_∣_> : (Γ : IsContext Δ) → Variables Δ → Usertypes Δ → IsContext Δ  
< 𝓒 ↦ vs ∣ U > =
  context << U
          ,  𝓒 .env .witnesses
          ,  𝓒 .env .circuits
          ,  𝓒 .env .builtin
          ,  𝓒 .env .ext
          ,  𝓒 .env .ledger
          >> vs 

<_v↦_> : (Γ : IsContext Δ) → Variables Δ → IsContext Δ
< 𝓒 v↦ vs > = < 𝓒 ↦ vs ∣ 𝓒 .env .utypes > 
```

## Operations on Contexts

We must define several operations on contexts to make sure that they can be appropriately updated in light of the
declaration of new (type)
variables or user types.

### Renaming

We start by defining renaming or callable objects. This allows us to refer to callable objects in a context where
additional type variables or user-declared types are in scope.

```agda
instance
  rename-callable
    : RenameT Callable
rename-callable .RenameT.renameT
  ρv ρu (callable params (mkTy _ wf) args)
  = callable
      (   (params .proj₁)
        , λ x y →
            renameT ρv ρu (params .proj₂ x y) ) 
      (   mkTy _ $
          renameT (rename-++ˡ ρv) (rename-++ˡ ρu) wf )
      (   Data.List.map (λ where (mkTy _ wf) → mkTy _ $ renameT (rename-++ˡ ρv) (rename-++ˡ ρu) wf) args ) 
```

As `Callable` simply store the types and well-formedness proofs of the callable's argument and return types, renaming
proceeds by renaming the stored proofs. Note that we need to extend the renaming to account for any type parameters
bound by the callable.

Next, we define renaming for the Kernel, which allows kernel operations to be referenced in contexts with additonal
bound variables, such as the body of a generic circuit. Since kernel operations are defined as `Callable` objects, we
define kernel renaming by referring to the `Callable` renaming instance defined above.

```agda 
instance
  rename-kernel
    : RenameT Kernel
rename-kernel .RenameT.renameT
  ρv ρu K
  = record
  { kernel
      = Data.List.map
          ( λ (name , κ) →
              name , renameT ρv ρu κ
          ) ( K .kernel )
  ; adt-ops
      = λ x y →
          Data.List.map
            (λ where
              (name , (κ , refl)) →
                name , renameT ρv ρu κ , refl 
            ) ( K .adt-ops x y )
  }
```

Then, the variables bound in the context may also be renamend. As we store bound variables with their well-formedness
proof, we proceed by renaming the associated proof for each variable.

And, finally, we also define renaming for user-declared types.

```agda

instance
  rename-usertype
    : RenameT λ Δ → Usertype Δ d
rename-usertype {enum}     .RenameT.renameT
  ρv ρu xs
  = xs
rename-usertype {struct _} .RenameT.renameT
  ρv ρu v∗
  = rename-vars (rename-++ˡ ρv) (rename-++ˡ ρu) v∗
      
instance
  rename-utypes
    : ∀ {u} → RenameT (λ Δ → UTypes Δ u) 
rename-utypes .RenameT.renameT
  ρv ρu ∅
  = ∅
rename-utypes .RenameT.renameT
  ρv ρu (ut ∷ u)
  = renameT ρv ρu ut ∷ renameT ρv ρu u
```

It is not possible to define general renaming for contexts. The reason for this is that such as renaming may also add
new user types to the type context, but since the context stores a definition for each declared user type, this would
require us to "invent" definitions for the user types that are added to the context by a renaming. Luckily, we do not
need renaming for context anywhere.

It is possible, on the other hand, to define a weaker operation that weakens a context w.r.t. an extension of only the
bound type variables. This operation is used, for example, in defining well-formedness of module declarations, where the
context that surrounds the module should be propagated into the module, but extended with any type variables bound in
the module header.

```agda
weaken-context : IsContext Δ → IsContext (type-param∗ ⋊ Δ)
weaken-context {type-param∗ = type-param∗}
  (context nv vs) =
  context
    << renameT (∈-++⁺ʳ _) id $ nv .utypes
    ,  (lmap (λ (name , w) → name , renameT ((∈-++⁺ʳ _)) id w) (nv .witnesses) )
    ,  (lmap (λ (name , w) → name , renameT ((∈-++⁺ʳ _)) id w) (nv .circuits) )
    ,  renameT (∈-++⁺ʳ _) id (nv .builtin)
    ,  (lmap (λ (name , xs) → name , lmap (λ (name , e) → name , renameT (∈-++⁺ʳ _) id e) xs) (nv .ext))
    ,  (lmap (λ (name , w) → name , renameT ((∈-++⁺ʳ _)) id w) (nv .ledger) )
    >> (rename-vars(∈-++⁺ʳ _) id vs) 

wk : ∀ type-param∗ → Context → Context
wk type-param∗ Γ = _ , weaken-context {type-param∗ = type-param∗} 𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩ 

```

### Type Declarations

Another important operation on contexts is extension with a newly declared user type. We define a generic operation for
exttending a context with a newly declared user type, which we later specialize to separate operations for enum and
structure declarations for convenience.

After declaring a new user type, the type context is extended with a new user type declaration, as witnessed in the type
of
`declareUType`. Declaration proceeds by extending the list of user declared types, and renaming the other declarations
correspondingly.

```agda 
declareUType
  : (name : Name)
  → Usertype Δ d
  → IsContext Δ
  → IsContext [ Δ u↦ (name , d) ∷ Δ .userTypes ] 
declareUType name ut (context nv vs) =
  context
    << renameT id there (ut ∷ nv .utypes)
    ,  rename-map id there (nv .witnesses)
    ,  rename-map id there (nv .circuits)
    ,  renameT id there (nv .builtin)
    ,  lmap (λ (name , v) → name , rename-map id there v) (nv .ext)
    ,  rename-map id there  (nv .ledger) 
    >> (rename-vars id there vs)
```

Then, the following operations describes the extension of a context with a new enum type, given by a name (the name of
the enum type), and a list of names (the names of the elements).

```agda
defineEnum
  : Name
  → List Name
  → (Context → Context) 
defineEnum name elt-name∗
  = λ Γ →
        declareEnum name Δ⟨ Γ ⟩
      , declareUType name elt-name∗ 𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩
```

Similarly, we define an operation `defineStruct` that describes the extension of a context with a newly declared
structure type. It relies on the following auxiliary operation that converts a set of well-formed arguments to
variables.

```agda 
argToVars
  : (wf : ∀ arg → arg ∈ arg∗ → Δ ⊢arg arg)
  → Variables Δ
argToVars {[]} wf
  = []
argToVars {arg@(unnamed name type) ∷ arg∗} wf
  with wf arg (here refl)
... | ⊢arg' x
  = (name , mkTy type  x) ∷ argToVars λ a → wf a ∘ there
```

Then, to define a new struct, we must supply several pieces of information:

* a list of type parameters bound by the structure type,

* a list of arguments (or, fields), and

* a set of proofs that the fields' types are well-formed.

Crucially, the types of the struct's fields must be well-formed with respect to the input type context, extended with
the type parameters bound by the structure declaration.

```agda 
defineStruct 
  : Name
  → ( type-param∗ : List Type-Param )
  → ( arg∗        : List Argument )
  → ( Γ           : Context )
  → ( wf          : ∀ arg → arg ∈ arg∗
                          → (type-param∗ ⋊ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) ⊢arg arg ) 
  → Context 
defineStruct name type-param∗ arg∗ Γ wf
  = declareStruct name type-param∗ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩
  , declareUType name (argToVars wf) 𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩
```

### Adding Binders

Beyond user-defined types, there are several other types of binders that a context may be extended with:

* variables bound by a `const` declaration,
* declared circuits, or
* declared witnesses.

```agda 
bindVar
  : (Name × ⊢Type Δ)
  → (IsContext Δ → IsContext Δ)
bindVar v
  = λ 𝓒 →
      context
        << (𝓒 .env .utypes)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .witnesses)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .circuits)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .builtin)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .ext)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .ledger)
        >> (v ∷ 𝓒 .vars) 

bindVars
  : Variables Δ
  → (IsContext Δ → IsContext Δ)
bindVars v∗ 𝓒
  = context (𝓒 .env) (v∗ ++ 𝓒 .vars) 

bindCircuit
  : (Name × Callable Δ)
  → (IsContext Δ → IsContext Δ)
bindCircuit ω 
  = λ 𝓒 →
      context
        << (𝓒 .env .utypes)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .witnesses)
        ,  (ω ∷ 𝓒 .env .circuits)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .builtin)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .ext)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .ledger)
        >> (𝓒 .vars) 

bindWitness
  : (Name × Callable Δ)
  → (IsContext Δ → IsContext Δ)
bindWitness w
  = λ 𝓒 →
      context
        << (𝓒 .env .utypes)
        ,  (w ∷ 𝓒 .env .witnesses)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .circuits)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .builtin)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .ext)
        ,  (𝓒 .env .ledger)
        >> (𝓒 .vars) 

bindLDecl
  : (Γ : Context)
  → (Name × LedgerType Δ⟨ Γ ⟩)
  → Context
bindLDecl Γ l
  = let 𝓒 = 𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩ in
    Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ,
      context
        << 𝓒 .env .utypes
        ,  𝓒 .env .witnesses
        ,  𝓒 .env .circuits
        ,  𝓒 .env .builtin
        ,  𝓒 .env .ext
        ,  (l ∷ 𝓒 .env .ledger)
        >> (𝓒 .vars) 
```

Additionally, we have the following operation that binds a collection of well-formed arguments in a context.

```agda

_⟨⋊⟩_
  : (∀ arg → arg ∈ arg∗ → Δ ⊢arg arg)
  → IsContext Δ
  → IsContext Δ
wf ⟨⋊⟩ 𝓒
  = context (𝓒 .env) (lmap argToType (⊢-enumerate wf) ++ 𝓒 .vars) 
  where
    argToType
      : ∃[ arg ] Δ ⊢arg arg
      → Name × ⊢Type Δ 
    argToType (unnamed name type , ⊢arg' wf)
      = name , mkTy type  wf

    ⊢-enumerate
      : {A : Set}
      → {P : A → Set}
      → {xs : List  A}
      → (∀ x → x ∈ xs → P x)
      → List  ∃⟨ P ⟩ 
    ⊢-enumerate {xs = []}     wf
      = []
    ⊢-enumerate {xs = x ∷ xs} wf
      = (x , wf x (here refl)) ∷ ⊢-enumerate λ x y → wf x (there y)
```

pos : ∀ {a}{A : Set a}{x : A}{xs} → x ∈ xs → ℕ
pos (here refl) = 0
pos (there x)   = suc (pos x)
```

## Numeric Types

Compact has a notion of "numeric" types that subsume several other types. It is the class of types that supports
arithmetic operations, such as addition.

### Definition

Numeric types can be fields or unsigned integers. The inductive relation `IsNumeric` witnesses that it's type index is a
numeric type.

```agda
data IsNumeric {Δ} : (τ : ⊢Type Δ) → Set where
  isField : IsNumeric ⊢field 
  isUint  : IsNumeric (⊢uint₁ ζ)
  -- TODO: other unsigned integer type 
```

We wrap proofs that a type is numeric in the folling record, to be able to assert numeric constraints using instance
arguments.

```agda 
record Numeric (τ : ⊢Type Δ) : Set where
  field
    isNum
      : IsNumeric τ
```

<!-- 
```agda 
open Numeric ⦃...⦄
```
--> 

Additionally, the following predicate asserts that a type is a well-formed unsigned integer type, but not a field.

```agda 
data UIntType (Δ : TypeContext) : (τ : ⊢Type Δ) → Set where

  isUint
    : ─────────────────────
      UIntType Δ (⊢uint₁ ζ)

  isUint1
    : ∀ {ζ^}
    → ────────────────────────
      UIntType Δ (⊢uint₂ ζ ζ^) 
```

### Computing Bounds

When performing arithmetic operations on numeric types, if the type is an unsigned integer type, the size bounds of the
value change. The following operations calculate the numeric type resulting from combining two numeric types with
arithmetic operations.

**TODO: define bound computation**

Sketch:

* Field + anything = Field
* Uint + Uint = Unit, with updated bounds
* How do we combine the differnt uints?

```agda
_⟨+⟩_
    : (τ₁ τ₂ : ⊢Type Δ)
    → ⦃ Numeric τ₁ ⦄
    → ⦃ Numeric τ₂ ⦄
    → ⊢Type Δ
_ ⟨+⟩ _ = ⊢undeclared  
    
_⟨*⟩_
  : (τ₁ τ₂ : ⊢Type Δ)
  → ⦃ Numeric τ₁ ⦄
  → ⦃ Numeric τ₂ ⦄
  →  ⊢Type Δ
_ ⟨*⟩ _ = ⊢undeclared 

_⟨-⟩_
  : (τ₁ τ₂ : ⊢Type Δ)
  → ⦃ Numeric τ₁ ⦄
  → ⦃ Numeric τ₂ ⦄
  → ⊢Type Δ 
_ ⟨-⟩ _ = ⊢undeclared

```

### Type Casts

Compact supports two types of casts between values of different types.

1. If `type₁ ⊑ type₂`, then we can cast a term of type `type₁` to a term of type `type₂` using the `as` construct.
   Furthermore, in some places, an implicit cast is inserted if we provide a term that has a sub-type of the expected
   type at that position. For example, when creating a vector literal of type `Vector[ n , T ]`, we must supply
   `n` expressions `exprᵢ : Tᵢ` where `Tᵢ ⊑ T` for `0 ≤ i ≤ n`.

2. Compact allows some casts between types that are not necessarily related by the subtyping relation. These must be
   explicityly cast using the `as` construct.

The `Castable` relation defines which types can be cast outside the subtyping relation. Note if `T₁ ⊑ T₂` then `T₁` is
automatically castable to `T₂`.

**TODO: convert the casting table in the language ref to the relation below**.

```agda
data Castable (τ₁ τ₂ : ⊢Type Δ) : Set where

  cast-⊑
    : τ₁ ⊑-⊢ τ₂
      ──────────────
      Castable τ₁ τ₂ 
```

_Note: we could consider also allowing "downcasting" along the subtyping relation. Assuming a `Set` semantics of types
and interpretation of subtyping as section/retraction pairs, there should always be a well-defined partial function from
a type to all its sub-typed_.

### Sequencing of Judgments

Several judments in the typng relation have the form `Γ ⊢ <TERM> ⊣
Γ′`, where `Γ` and `Γ′` capture the contextual information respectively before and after some term-level object
`<TERM>`. For example, when declaring a new circuit the context after the circuit is updated to include the
newly-declared circuit. This way, other program elements that succede the circuit declaration can reference it.

The `Sequence` relation transformer provides a general way of sequencing judgments that describe a context
transformation, transforming a relation over some index `I` (with two additional positions for the before- and
after-context) into a relation over a list of `I`s. Given a judgment `P : Context → I → Context → Set`, where a proof
`P Γ i Γ′` witnesses that `i` is well-formed under context `Γ` and updates to context `Γ′`, a proof `Sequence P xs Γ Γ′`
witnesses that all `i ∈ xs` are well-formed w.r.t. `P` under context
`Γ` and updating to context `Γ′`.

```agda
Sequence
  : {I : Set} 
  → (P : Context → I → Context → Set)
  → List I
  → (Γ Γ′ : Context)
  → Set
Sequence P [] Γ Γ′
  = Γ ≡ Γ′ 
Sequence P (i ∷ []) Γ Γ′
  = P Γ i Γ′
Sequence P (i ∷ j ∷ xs) Γ Γ′
         = ∃ λ Γ′′ → P Γ i Γ′′ × Sequence P (j ∷ xs) Γ′′ Γ

```

Well-formedness of such sequence is witnessed by having a sequence of proofs of `P`, where the "intermediate" contexts
are existentially quantified and required to match. That is, we prove `Sequence P [ i₁ ,
i₂ ] Γ Γ′` by showing that there exists some `Γ′′` such that `P Γ i₁
Γ′′` and `P Γ′′ i₂ Γ′` both hold. The definition of `Sequence` above generalizes this principle to sequences of
arbitrary length.

```agda
Struct
  : Context → Set
Struct Γ
  = ∃[ name ] ∃[ type-param∗ ] (name , struct type-param∗) ∈ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ .userTypes

getParams : ∃[ Γ ] Struct Γ → List Type-Param
getParams (_ , name , type-param∗ , px) = type-param∗
```

<!--
```agda
mutual  
```
-->

# Typing Rules

Before setting out to define the typign rules of term-level objects in Compact, we highlight the use of modal
possibility to capture the pattern where sub-terms can have _any subtype_ of some type, rather than being restricted to
some _exact_ type. That is, we write `◇ P
type` to indicate that we have a proof `P type′` for any `type′ ⊑
type`. This so-called _diamond_ or _possibility_ modality for predicates over types unfolds as follows.

`◇ P type ≜ ∃ type′ . P type′ ∧ type′ ⊑ type`

By using the possibility modality to declare where subtypes are allowed results in an _algorithmic_ presentation of the
typing rules, in the sense that the rules are explict about when implicit casts from sub-types to super-types are
inserted. The benefit of this is that we can maintain a _syntax-directed_ or _deterministic_ definition of the type
system, meaning that for every syntactic construct there is at most one inference rule that could be used at the root of
the proof tree. The alternative would be to have a separate rule for subtype casting. While this would be an equivalent
formulation of the system, it simultaneously makes it harder to relate the type system to the untyped syntax as well as
leaving it unclear where subtype casts ought to be inserted.

## Pattern Argument Declaration

Pattern argument declarations are well-formed with respect to a type context `Δ`.

```agda
  infix 5 _⊢parg_⦂_
  data _⊢parg_⦂_ (η : Env′)
    : Pattern-Argument
    → ⊢Type Δ[ η ] × Variables Δ[ η ]
    → Set where

    ⊢parg'
      : ∀ v∗
      → η ⊢pat pat ⦂ (τ , v∗) 
        ──────────────────────────────────────
        η ⊢parg unnamed pat (τ .ty) ⦂ (τ , v∗)

  record PatArg (η : Env′) : Set where
    pattern 
    constructor mkPatArg
    field
      pat-arg                           : Pattern-Argument
      pat-type                          : ⊢Type Δ[ η ]
      boundVars                    : Variables Δ[ η ] 
      well-formed-pattern-argument : η ⊢parg pat-arg ⦂ (pat-type , boundVars) 

  variable ψ ψ₁ ψ₂ ψ₃ ψ′ : PatArg η
           ψ∗ : List (PatArg η) 

  collect-vars : (Γ : Context) → List (PatArg η⟨ Γ ⟩) → Variables Δ⟨ Γ ⟩
  collect-vars _ = foldr (λ ψ → ψ .PatArg.boundVars ++_) []

  bindPats : (Γ : Context) → List (PatArg η⟨ Γ ⟩) → Context
  bindPats Γ ψ∗ = Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ , bindVars (collect-vars Γ ψ∗) 𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩

  pat-erase : PatArg η → Pattern-Argument
  pat-erase = PatArg.pat-arg

  pat-erase∗ : List (PatArg η) → List (Pattern-Argument)
  pat-erase∗ = lmap pat-erase

  pat→type : PatArg η → ⊢Type Δ[ η ] 
  pat→type = PatArg.pat-type

  pat→type∗ : List (PatArg η) → List (⊢Type Δ[ η ])
  pat→type∗ = lmap pat→type

```

## Expressions

### Well-Formed Expressions

```agda
  record ⊢Expr (Γ : Context) (τ :  ⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) : Set where
    inductive 
    constructor mkEx 
    field
      ex                     : Expression 
      well-formed-expression : Γ ⊢expr ex ⦂ τ 

  ↓[_]  : ∀ {τ : ⊢Type Δ′} {f : ⊢Type Δ′ → ⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ } → ◇ (⊢Expr Γ ∘ f) τ → Expression 
  ↓[_] = ⊢Expr.ex ∘ px

  ↓[_]∗ : ∀ {τ∗ : List (⊢Type Δ′)} {f : ⊢Type Δ′ → ⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ } → All (◇ (⊢Expr Γ ∘ f)) τ∗ → List Expression 
  ↓[_]∗ = reduce ↓[_]

  h = head
  t = tail 

  variable ε₁ ε₂ ε′ ε : ⊢Expr Γ τ 
```

Compact expresions are well-formed with respect to a context `Γ`, and the type of the expression.

```agda
  data _⊢expr_⦂_ (Γ : Context)
    : Expression
    → ⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ 
    → Set where
```

### Literals

Literals in compact can be booleans, fields or byte vectors. They are trivially well-formed.

```agda
    ⊢expr-quote′
      : ───────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr quote′ (inj₂ Bool.true) ⦂ ⊢bool
```

### Variable References

A variable references are well-formed if the referenced name points to a well-formed type in the variable set stored in
`Γ`.

```agda
    ⊢expr-var-ref
      : (name , τ) ∈ 𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩ .vars
        ────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr var-ref name ⦂ τ 
```

### Default Values

Default expressions are well-formed if the referenced ADT type is well-formed under the type context associated with
`Γ`.

```agda
    ⊢expr-default
      : (τ : ⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) 
      → ───────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr default (τ .ty) ⦂ τ 
```

### Conditionals (if-then-else)

A conditional expression `if <expr> then <expr> else <expr>` is well-formed if

* the condition expression has type boolean,
* the branches are well-formed with types `type₁` and `type₂`
  respectively, and
* `type₁`, `type₂`, and their maximum are well-formed types.

The type of the conditional expression is the maximum of `type₁` and
`type₂`. Or, in other words, it must be the case that `type₁ ⊑ type₂`
or `type₂ ⊑ type₁`, with the type of the expression being either
`type₁` or `type₂` depending on which holds.

```agda                     
    ⊢expr-if
      : Γ ⊢expr expr ⦂ ⊢bool
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ τ₁
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ₂
      → τ .ty ≡-max⟨ τ₁ .ty , τ₂ .ty ⟩ 
        ───────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr if expr expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ τ 
```

### TODO

```agda
    -- TODO: what are these? 
    ⊢expr-elt-ref         : Γ ⊢expr elt-ref expr name ⦂ τ
    ⊢expr-elt-call   : Γ ⊢expr elt-call expr name expr∗ ⦂ τ 
```

## Assignment Expressions

There are three types of assignment, "normal" assignment, increment assignment, and decrement assignment.

```agda
    ⊢expr-=′ : Γ ⊢expr =′ expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ ⊢tuple []

    ⊢expr-+= : Γ ⊢expr += expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ ⊢tuple []

    ⊢expr--= : Γ ⊢expr -= expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ ⊢tuple [] 
```

### Vector Literals

A vector literal expression is well-formed if the type of stored values, `type`, is well-formed, and we have `n`
well-formed expressions with a sub-type of `type` where `n` is the length of the vector.

```agda
    ⊢expr-tuple
      : ( ε∗ : All (◇ (⊢Expr Γ)) τ∗ ) 
      → ──────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr tuple ↓[ ε∗ ]∗ ⦂ ⊢tuple τ∗
```

```agda
    ⊢expr-vector
      : ( ε∗ : All (◇ (⊢Expr Γ)) (replicate n τ) )
      → ─────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr tuple ↓[ ε∗ ]∗ ⦂ ⊢vector (⊢quote n) τ
```

### Vector Indexing

A vector index expression is well-formed if the indexed expression is well-formed with a vector type whose value type
and size are well-formed.

**TODO: static bounds checking?**

```agda 
    ⊢expr-tuple-ref
      : (ε : ⊢Expr Γ (⊢tuple τ∗))
      → (px : τ ∈ τ∗)   
      → ────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr tuple-ref (ε .⊢Expr.ex) (toℕ px) ⦂ τ

    ⊢expr-vector-ref
      : (ε : ⊢Expr Γ (⊢vector (⊢quote n) τ))
      → (i : Fin n) 
      → ────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr tuple-ref (ε .⊢Expr.ex) (Ftoℕ i) ⦂ τ
```

### Arithmetic Operations

The typing rules for addition, subtraction, and multiplication expressions all follow the same pattern. They are
well-formed if

1. the types of both sub-expressions are numeric types,
2. the types of both sub-expressions are well-formed, and
3. both sub-expressions are well-formed.

The type of the resulting expression depends on the input types, and which operation we use. That is, when operating on
unsigned integer types, the size bound of the resulting expression depends on which operation we used. For example, when
adding two unsigned integers, we take the sum of their size bounds.

```agda
    ⊢expr-+
      : ⦃ _ : Numeric τ₁ ⦄
      → ⦃ _ : Numeric τ₂ ⦄
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ τ₁
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ₂ 
        ───────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr + expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ (τ₁ ⟨+⟩ τ₂) 
        
    ⊢expr--
      : ⦃ _ : Numeric τ₁ ⦄
      → ⦃ _ : Numeric τ₂ ⦄
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ τ₁
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ₂ 
        ───────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr - expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ (τ₁ ⟨-⟩ τ₂)
        
    ⊢expr-*
      : ⦃ _ : Numeric τ₁ ⦄
      → ⦃ _ : Numeric τ₂ ⦄
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ τ₁
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ₂ 
        ───────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr * expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ (τ₁ ⟨*⟩ τ₂)
```

### Boolean Operations

All boolean expressions are well-formed with the boolean type if their sub-expression (s) are also well-formed with the
boolean type.

```agda
    ⊢expr-or
      : Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ ⊢bool
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ
      → tboolean ⊑ τ .ty 
        ──────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr or expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ τ 
        
    ⊢expr-and
      : Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ ⊢bool
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ
      → tboolean ⊑ τ .ty 
        ───────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr and expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ τ
        
    ⊢expr-not
      : Γ ⊢expr expr ⦂ ⊢bool
        ────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr not expr ⦂ ⊢bool
```

### Comparison Operations

All typing rules for comparison operators that compare for inequality follow the same pattern. Both sub expressions are
required to be well-formed w.r.t. some well-formed unsigned integer type. Furthermore, we must be able to relate the
types of the sub-expressions using the subtyping relation. Comparison operations have the boolean type.

```agda
    ⊢expr-<
      : UIntType (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) τ₁
      → UIntType (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) τ₂
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ τ₁
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ₂ 
      → ( τ₁ ⊑-⊢ τ₂ ⊎ τ₂ ⊑-⊢ τ₁ )
      → ─────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr < expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ ⊢bool
        
    ⊢expr-<=
      : UIntType (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) τ₁
      → UIntType (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) τ₂ 
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ τ₁
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ₂
      → ( τ₁ ⊑-⊢ τ₂ ⊎ τ₂ ⊑-⊢ τ₁ )
        ─────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr <= expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ ⊢bool
        
    ⊢expr->
      : UIntType (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) τ₁
      → UIntType (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) τ₂ 
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ τ₁
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ₂
      → ( τ₁ ⊑-⊢ τ₂ ⊎ τ₂ ⊑-⊢ τ₁ )
        ─────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr > expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ ⊢bool 
        
    ⊢expr->=
      : UIntType (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) τ₁
      → UIntType (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) τ₂ 
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ τ₁
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ₂
      → ( τ₁ ⊑-⊢ τ₂ ⊎ τ₂ ⊑-⊢ τ₁ )
        ──────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr >= expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ ⊢bool 
```

When comparing two expressions for equality, both sub-expressions must be well-formed w.t.r. a well-formed typed.
Furthermore, we must be able to relate the types of the sub-expressions using the subtyping relation. The resulting
expression has the boolean type.

```agda 
    ⊢expr-==
      : Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ τ₁
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ₂
      → ( τ₁ ⊑-⊢ τ₂ ⊎ τ₂ ⊑-⊢ τ₁ )
        ──────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr == expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ ⊢bool 
        
    ⊢expr-!=
      : Γ ⊢expr expr₁ ⦂ τ₁
      → Γ ⊢expr expr₂ ⦂ τ₂
      → ( τ₁ ⊑-⊢ τ₂ ⊎ τ₂ ⊑-⊢ τ₁ )
        ──────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr != expr₁ expr₂ ⦂ ⊢bool  
```

### Map Expressions

Map expressions allow us to apply a circuit to all elements in a vector. Map expressions in Compact furthermore allow a
multi-argument circuit to be mapped over a series of vectors, whose value type should match the corresponding argument
type of the circuit.

A map expression of the form `map <fun> <expr> <expr*>` is well-formed if:

* the function object `fun` is well-formed w.r.t. the context `Γ` and whose number of arguments matches the number of
  vector expressions (`wf₁` and `eq`),

* `tsize` is a well-formed size-expression (`wf₂`), and

* for each argument of the function object, we have a well-formed expression with a vector type with length `tsize`
  whose value type is a well-formed _sub-type_ of the expected argument type at that position when substituting for free
  occurences of type variables bound by the function object `fun` (`wf₃`).

The resulting expression has a vector type with size `tsize` and value type given by the return type of the function
object `fun` with free occurences of type variables bound by the circuit substituted for their instantiation.

```agda
    ⊢expr-map
      : ( fn  : ⊢Fun Γ )
      → ( ε₁ : ◇ (⊢Expr Γ ∘ ⊢vector ζ) τ₁ )
        ( ε∗ : All (◇ (⊢Expr Γ ∘ ⊢vector ζ)) τ∗ )
      → argsT fn ≡ τ₁ ∷ τ∗ 
        ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr map f[ fn ] ↓[ ε₁ ] ↓[ ε∗ ]∗ ⦂ ⊢vector ζ (returnT fn)
```

We enforce that the amount and type of sub-expressions of a map expression match the "shape" of the function object that
we are mapping with constructively. That is, the vector sub-expressions of a map expressions are defined to be the
(untyped) expressions we get by projecting out of the proof object `wf₃`, which witnesses that we have a matching
well-formed vector-expression for each of the arguments
`fun`.

### Fold Expressions

Fold expressions allow us to aggregate the values in a vector or series of vectors using a given function object. A fold
epxression takes a function object that describes how results should be aggregated, a base expression describing a seed
or initial value (i.e., how to aggregate the results in an empty vector), and one or more vector, depending on the type
signature of the function we are folding with.

A fold expression in Compact is well-formed if:

* `fun` is a well-formed function object under the context `Γ` (`wf₁`),

* `tsize` is a well-formed vector expression (`wf₂`),

* `fun` has at least 2 arguments (`eq₂`),

* for each argument to `fun`, except the 1st one, we have a well-formed expression with a vector type with length
  `tsize` whose value type is a well-formed _sub-type_ of the expected argument type at that position when substituting
  for free occurences of the variables bound by `fun` (`wf₃`),

* the expression corresponding to the initial value of the computation, `expr′`, is well-formed w.r.t. the context `Γ`
  and has a sub-type of the return type of `fun` with its type variables instantiated (`wf₄`),

* The first argument of `fun` matches its return type (`eq₂`).

The resulting expression has the return type of `fun`, with a substitution applied to instantiate any type variables
bound by `fun`.

```agda
    ⊢expr-fold
      : ( fn     : ⊢Fun Γ )
        ( ε-init : ◇ (⊢Expr Γ) (returnT fn) )
        ( ε₁     : ◇ (⊢Expr Γ ∘ ⊢vector ζ) τ )
        ( ε∗     : All (◇ (⊢Expr Γ ∘ ⊢vector ζ)) τ∗ )
      → argsT fn ≡ returnT fn ∷ τ ∷ τ∗ 
        ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr fold f[ fn ] ↓[ ε-init ] ↓[ ε₁ ] ↓[ ε∗ ]∗ ⦂ returnT fn
```

Again, we ensforce that the input vector (s) match the argument types of `fun` by projecting the untyped syntax out of
the well-formedness proof `wf₃`.

### "Function" Calls

Compact supports a uniform syntax for invoking different kinds of
"function-like" objects, such as witnesses, circuits, or ADT operations. A call to a "function-like" object is
well-formed if

* the referenced function object, `fun`, is well-formed under context
  `Γ` (`wf₁`), and

* For each argument to `fun`, we have a well-formed expression with a sub-type of the expected type at that position
  (`wf₂`) with a substitution applied that instantiates any type variables bound by the function object.

```agda
    ⊢expr-call
      : ( fn : ⊢Fun Γ )
        ( ε∗ : All (◇ (⊢Expr Γ)) (argsT fn) ) 
      → ──────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr call f[ fn ] ↓[ ε∗ ]∗ ⦂ returnT fn
```

The argument expressions are defined by projecting from the well-formedness proof `wf₂`.

### Structure Creations

In Compact, values of structure types can be created by supplying an expression for each field of the struct.
Additionally, we must supply instantiations for any type variables bound by the struct.

A `new` expression (creating a new value of a structure type) is well-formed if:

* the referenced structure name is a known declared struct (`px`)

* the given type arguments (`targ∗`) match the type parambers bound by the structure (`m`),

* for each type argument in `targ∗`, we have a proof that it is well-formed (`wf`), and

* we have a set of well-formed arguments matching with the fields of the struct (`args`) .

The arguments can be supplied either by giving named or positional arguments corresponding to each field of the struct,
or through a spread expression. The precise meaning of these is defined in the
`StructArgs` and `Spread` predicates, which we will discuss later.

```agda
    ⊢expr-new
      : ( τ?∗ : List (Maybe (⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩)))
      → ( px : (name , struct type-param∗) ∈ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ .userTypes )
      → ( m  : Match-Param-Arg∗ type-param∗ targ∗ )
      → ( wf : All (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ⊢targ_) targ∗ ) 
      → let σ = args-subst wf m in
        --      ^ a substitution that describes the instantiation of
        --        type paramters bound by the structure.
        ( args : All (⊢New-Field (Γ , name , type-param∗ , px)) τ?∗)
        -- TODO: well-formedness of argument list wrt struct type 
      → ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr new (type-ref name targ∗) ↓[ args ]nf∗
            ⦂ ⊢ref (⊢tref-type-ref (struct (type-param∗ , (px , m))) wf) 
```

### Sequencing

Expressions can be sequenced for their effects. A sequence of expressions is well-formed if all expressions in the
sequence are well-formed, with the same type.

-- TODO: should this be the same type or can it be a sub-type?

```agda
    ⊢expr-seq
      : (ε∗ : All (◇ (⊢Expr Γ)) (replicate n τ)) 
      → Γ ⊢expr expr ⦂ τ
        ──────────────────────────────────────── 
        Γ ⊢expr seq ↓[ ε∗ ]∗ expr ⦂ τ
```

### Explicit Casts

A cast expression is well-formed if the source and target types are well-formed, as well as the expression we want to
cast. Furthermore, the source and target types should be related by the `Castable`
relation, which defines which types, that are not in the sub-type relation, can be casted.

**TODO: do we allow casting along the subtype relation here as well?**

```agda
    ⊢expr-cast
      : Γ ⊢expr expr ⦂ τ′
      → Castable τ′ τ
        ─────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr cast (τ .ty) expr ⦂ τ
```

### Disclose

```agda
    ⊢expr-disclose
      : Γ ⊢expr expr ⦂ τ
        ─────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢expr disclose expr ⦂ τ
```

### Assert

An assert expression is well-formed if the given expression is well-formed with the `tboolean` type.

```agda
    ⊢stmt-assert
      : ∀ msg
      → (ε : ⊢Expr Γ ⊢bool)
      → ──────────────────────────────────────────── 
        Γ ⊢expr assert (ε .⊢Expr.ex) msg ⦂ ⊢tuple [] 
```

## Patterns

```agda
  data _⊢pat_⦂_ (η : Env′)
    : Pattern
    → ⊢Type Δ[ η ] × Variables Δ[ η ]
    → Set where
```

```agda
    ⊢pattern-var
      : ───────────────────────────────────────────
        η ⊢pat var-name name ⦂ (τ , [ name , τ ])
```

```agda
    ⊢pattern-tuple
      : ∀ pat?∗ v∗s
      → (wf : Pointwise
                (λ pat? (τ , v∗) → maybe′ (η ⊢pat_⦂ (τ , v∗)) ⊤ pat?)
                pat?∗ (zip τ∗ v∗s))
      → ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       η ⊢pat tuple pat?∗ ⦂ (⊢tuple τ∗ , concat v∗s)
```

```agda
    ⊢pattern-struct
      : ( px : (name , struct type-param∗) ∈ Δ[ η ] .userTypes )
      → ( m  : Match-Param-Arg∗ type-param∗ targ∗ )
      → ( wf₁ : All (Δ[ η ] ⊢targ_) targ∗ )
      → let σ = args-subst wf₁ m in
        --      ^ a substitution that describes the instantiation of
        --        type paramters bound by the structure.
        ( wf₂ : List
                  ( ∃₂ λ pat name →
                      ∃[ τ ]
                          ((name , τ) ∈ fields _ px (nv[ η ] .utypes))
                        × ∃[ v∗ ] (η ⊢pat pat ⦂ (substT (subst-⋊ _ σ) τ , v∗))
                  ))
      → ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        η ⊢pat struct (lmap (λ (pat , name , _) → pat , name) wf₂)
          ⦂ (⊢ref (⊢tref-type-ref (struct (type-param∗ , px , m)) wf₁)
          , concat (lmap (λ (_ , _ , _ , _ , v∗ , _) → v∗) wf₂))
```

## New Fields

When constructing a value of a structure type in Compact, we have to supply a set of field expressions. These can be
either a named or positional argument corresponding to a particular field, or a spread expression.

Field expressions are typed under a tuple of a context `Γ` and struct type `T` (the struct for which we are supplying
fields), and maybe a type. That is, in case of a named or positional field expression, the judgment records the type of
the expression, which coincides with the type of the corresponding field. For spread expressions, we only need the type
of the struct we are constructing.

```agda
  data _⊢new-field_⦂_ (Γ×T : ∃[ Γ ] Struct Γ)
     : New-Field
     → Maybe (⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ×T .proj₁ ⟩)
     → Set where
```

### Spread expressions

A spread field expression is well-formed if we have a well-formed expression with a struct type that matches with the
struct associated with the field expression, and whose type arguments match the type parameters of this struct.

```agda
    ⊢new-field-spread
      : ( m   : Match-Param-Arg∗ (Γ×T .proj₂ .proj₂ .proj₁) targ∗)
      → ( wf₁ : All (_ ⊢targ_) targ∗)   
      → let struct-type =
              ⊢ref (⊢tref-type-ref
                 (struct ( Γ×T .proj₂ .proj₂ .proj₁
                         , Γ×T .proj₂ .proj₂ .proj₂
                         , m )
                         ) wf₁) in
        --  ^ the (well-formed) type of the struct type we are
        --  consructing
        (ε : ⊢Expr (Γ×T .proj₁) struct-type  ) 
      → ───────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ×T ⊢new-field (spread (ε. ⊢Expr.ex)) ⦂ nothing 
```

### Named and positional fields

Named and positional field expressions are well-formed if we have a well-formed expression whose type matches the
expected type for the field in question.

```agda
    ⊢new-field-positional
      : (ε : ⊢Expr (Γ×T .proj₁) τ)
      → ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ×T ⊢new-field (positional (⊢Expr.ex ε)) ⦂ just τ 

    ⊢new-field-named
      : (ε : ⊢Expr (Γ×T .proj₁) τ)
      → ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ×T ⊢new-field (named name (⊢Expr.ex ε)) ⦂ just τ
```

```agda
  record ⊢New-Field (Γ×T : ∃[ Γ ] Struct Γ ) (τ? : Maybe (⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ×T .proj₁ ⟩)) : Set where
    inductive
    constructor mkNF
    field
      nf : New-Field
      well-formed-new-field : Γ×T ⊢new-field nf ⦂ τ?

  ↓[_]nf : ∀ {Γ×T τ?} → ⊢New-Field Γ×T τ? → New-Field
  ↓[_]nf = ⊢New-Field.nf

  ↓[_]nf∗ : ∀ {Γ×T xs} → All (⊢New-Field Γ×T) xs → List New-Field
  ↓[_]nf∗ = reduce ↓[_]nf 
```

## Structure Construction

To describe the set of arguments given when constructing a new value of a structure type, we define two predicates:

* `StructArgs`, describing a list of well-formed field expressions that contains exactly one name or positional field
  expression for each field in the structure type, and

* `Spread`, describing a list of well-formed field expressions that starts with a spread expression, following by a tail
  that has at most one named or positional field expression for each field of the struct.

## Ledger Constructors

Ledger constructors initialize the contract state. As the ledger constructor is a "program element" (i.e., a top level
declaration), we maintain the same shape of judgment as for other program elements, which are typed w.r.t. a "before"
and "after" context that capture how a program element changes the context. While ledger constructors don't change the
context, we maintain the shape of the judgment for uniformity of the presenatation.

**TODO: is it true that ledger constructrs don't alter the global context?**

**TODO: should we force that there is at most 1 ledger constructor per contract?**

```agda
  data _⊢lconstructor_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Ledger-Constructor
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
```

A ledger constructor is well-formed if all its arguments are well-formed, and its body is a well-formed statement
(block) returning
`tvoid`.

**TODO: should there return type of a ledger constructor forced to be void?**

```agda
    ⊢constructor
      : (ψ∗ : List (PatArg η⟨ Γ ⟩)) 
      → (bindPats Γ ψ∗ , ⊢void) ⊢stmt stmt ⊣ v∗
        ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢lconstructor constructor′ (pat-erase∗ ψ∗) stmt ⊣ Γ
```

## External Contract Circuits

** TODO: should the externally-declared circuit be available to call after the declaration?**

```agda
  data _⊢edecl-circuit_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : External-Contract-Circuit
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where

    ⊢edecl-circuit
      : All (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ⊢arg_) arg∗ 
        ─────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢edecl-circuit unnamed b name arg∗ type ⊣ Γ
```

## Statements

Well-formedness of statements in Compact is defined w.r.t. a tuple
`Γ×R` consisting of the context of all declarations in scope together with the return type of the current statement
block, as well as an
"updated" term level context that is typed under the same type context as the input context `Γ`. The updated context
contains additional binders that may be added to the context after some statements, such as `const` declarations.

```agda
  data _⊢stmt_⊣_ (Γ×R : ∃[ Γ ] ⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩)
    : Statement
    → Variables Δ⟨ Γ×R .proj₁ ⟩ 
    → Set where
```

### Expression Statements

All Compact expressions can be used in place where a statement is expected. This has the result of enacting the effects
of evaluating the expression, while discarding the value that it evaluates to. An expression statement is well-formed if
the expression is well-formed w.r.t. some well-formed type. A statement expression has the unit return type (i.e., a
vector of length 0); if we intend to return the result of the expression, we should explicitly use the `return`
keyword instead.

```agda
    ⊢stmt-expr
      : (ε : ⊢Expr (Γ×R .proj₁) τ)
      → Γ×R .proj₂ .ty ≡ tvector (type-size 0) tundeclared --> unit type 
        ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ×R ⊢stmt statement-expression (⊢Expr.ex ε) ⊣ [] 
```

### Return Statement

A return statement is well-formed if the returned expression is well-formed, and the type of the returned expression is
a sub-type of the expected return type as dictated by the surrounding context.

```agda
    ⊢stmt-return
      : (ε : ◇ (⊢Expr $ Γ×R .proj₁) (Γ×R .proj₂))
      → ─────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ×R ⊢stmt return ↓[ ε ] ⊣ [] 
```

### Constant Binding

A constant binding (or, local variable) is well-formed if

1. the given ADT type (`adt-type`) of the binding is well formed, and

2. the given expression is well-formed w.r.t. the ADT type's conversion to a compact type.

After a `const` statement, the term level context is updated to bind a new variable with the given name and type.

```agda
    ⊢stmt-const
      : ∀ v∗ 
      → η⟨ Γ×R .proj₁ ⟩ ⊢pat pat ⦂ (τ , v∗)
      → (ε : ⊢Expr (Γ×R .proj₁) τ)
      → ──────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ×R ⊢stmt const pat (τ .ty) (ε .⊢Expr.ex) ⊣ v∗ 
```

### If-then-else Statement

An if-then-else statement is well-formed if the conditional expression is well-formed with type `tboolean`, and both
branches are well-formed statements.

Both branches of an if-then-else stament may result in (diffrent)
updates to the surrounding context. None of these updates propagate to surrounding context of the if-then-else
statement, since any variables bound in either of the branches will be out of scope outside the respective branch.

```agda
    ⊢stmt-if
      : (ε : ⊢Expr (Γ×R .proj₁) ⊢bool) 
      → (𝓢₁ : ⊢Stmt Γ×R v∗₁)
      → (𝓢₂ : ⊢Stmt Γ×R v∗₂) 
      → ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ×R ⊢stmt if (ε .⊢Expr.ex) ↓[ 𝓢₁ ]stmt ↓[ 𝓢₂ ]stmt ⊣ []
```

### For Loop

A for-loop is well-formed if the scrutinee is well-formed with a
`tvector` type (with well-formed value type and size expression), and the body is a well-formed statement with the
iteration variable `name`
bound to an unsigned integer type bounded by the size of the vector expression. The body of the loop may update the
term-level context arbitrarily, but these changes are ignored in the surrounding context.

```agda
    ⊢stmt-for
      : ∀ name 
      → (ε : ⊢Expr (Γ×R .proj₁) (⊢vector ζ τ)) 
      → (𝓢 : ⊢Stmt ((-, bindVar (name , ⊢uint₁ ζ) 𝓒⟨ Γ×R .proj₁ ⟩) , Γ×R .proj₂) v∗) 
      → ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ×R ⊢stmt for name (ε .⊢Expr.ex) ↓[ 𝓢 ]stmt ⊣ [] 
```

### Statement Block

A block of statements is well-formed if all statements in the block are well-formed, with matching in- and output
contexts.

```agda
    ⊢stmt-block
      : (b : Block Γ×R v∗)
      → ────────────────────────────────
        Γ×R ⊢stmt block ↓[ b ]block ⊣ v∗
```

The shape of judgments that define well-formedness of statements is slightly assymetric, in the sense that the "input"
context has an additional value for the type of values returned by the statement, and the "output" context is only the
projection of the term-level bindings. This means that we cannot pass the judgment directly to the
`Sequence` transformer, but rather we have to include an additional equality proof that witnesses that the type context
remains invariant throughout the sequence.

```agda
  record ⊢Stmt (Γ×R : ∃[ Γ ] ⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) (v∗ : Variables Δ⟨ Γ×R .proj₁ ⟩) : Set where
    inductive
    constructor mkStmt
    field
      statement : Statement
      well-formed-statement : Γ×R ⊢stmt statement ⊣ v∗

  data Block (Γ×R : ∃[ Γ ] ⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) (v∗ : Variables Δ⟨ Γ×R .proj₁ ⟩) : Set where
    empty : Block Γ×R v∗
    cons  : ⊢Stmt Γ×R v∗₁ → Block ((-, bindVars v∗₁ 𝓒⟨ Γ×R .proj₁ ⟩) , Γ×R .proj₂) v∗ → Block Γ×R v∗ 

    
  ↓[_]block : ∀ {Γ×R v∗} → Block Γ×R v∗ → List Statement
  ↓[ empty ]block = []
  ↓[ cons x b ]block = x .⊢Stmt.statement ∷ ↓[ b ]block

  ↓[_]stmt : ∀ {Γ×R v∗} → ⊢Stmt Γ×R v∗ → Statement
  ↓[_]stmt = ⊢Stmt.statement
```

## Structure Definitions

A structure definition is well-formed with respect to input and output contexts `Γ` and `Γ′`.

**TODO: the defined structure should be exported based on the boolean flag. **

```agda
  data _⊢structdef_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Structure-Definition
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
```

The structure definition is then well-formed if

* all declared type parameters are well-formed (`wf₁`), and

* all declared fields are well-formed under the surrounding type context extended with the type parameters bound by the
  structure (`wf₂`).

```agda
    ⊢structdef
      : ( wf₁ : ∀ type-param → type-param ∈ type-param∗
                             → Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ⊢type-param type-param )
      → ( wf₂ : ∀ arg → arg ∈ arg∗
                      → (type-param∗ ⋊ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) ⊢arg arg )
      → ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢structdef struct b name type-param∗ arg∗
                   ⊣ defineStruct name type-param∗ arg∗ Γ wf₂ 
```

The declared structure type is bound in the output context.

## Ledger Declarations

A ledger declaration adds a new field to the contract's internal state. A ledger delcaration is well-formed if the
declared type is a well-formed ADT type.

**TODO: how do the values of the boolean flags affect the semantics?**

```agda
  data _⊢ldecl_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Ledger-Declaration
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
    
    ⊢ldecl
      : (l : LedgerType Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) 
      → ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
        Γ ⊢ldecl public-ledger-declaration b₁ b₂ name (l .proj₁ .ty)
          ⊣ bindLDecl Γ (name , l) 
```

## Import Declarations

An import declaration is well-formed if the supplied type arguments for the module are all well-formed.

**TODO: should the static semantics reflect a requirement that the module is in scope? **

**TODO: import declarations should bring exported names from the imported module into scope.**

**TODO: should there be a requirement that the the supplied type arguments match the modules signature?**

```agda
  data _⊢idecl_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Import-Declaration
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
    
    ⊢idecl
      : ( iname : Γ ⊢import-name import-name) 
      → ( ∀ targ → targ ∈ targ∗ → Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ⊢targ targ )
        ─────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢idecl import′ import-name targ∗ name′ ⊣ Γ

```

## Import Names

```agda

  data _⊢import-name_ (Γ : Context)
    : Import-Name
    → Set where

    ⊢import-module
      : ───────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢import-name module-name name  

    ⊢import-file
      : ────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢import-name file name

```

## Functions reference

Well-formedess of function-like objects is defined with respect to the surrounding term-level context `Γ`.

```agda
  record ⊢Fun Γ : Set where
    inductive
    constructor mkFun 
    field
      f                    : Function
      well-formed-function : Γ ⊢fun f 

  f[_] : ⊢Fun Γ → Function
  f[ fn ] = ⊢Fun.f fn 
  
  data _⊢fun_ (Γ : Context)
    : Function
    → Set where
```

Syntactically, we distinguish 3 types of function-like objects:

1. references to monomorphic callables (i.e., with 0 generic type parameters),

2. references to generic callables (i.e., with 1 or more generic type parameters), and

3. anonymous circuits (which are always monomorphic).

The `FRef` predicate (defined below) defines the different ways in wich we can refer to callable objects in the context.

### Monomorphic Functions

A reference to a monomorphic callable object is well-formed if the referenced name maps to a callable `κ` in the
context, and this callable has exactly 0 type parameters.

```agda
    ⊢fun-mono
      : Fun name (𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩ .env) (callable ([] , (λ _ ())) τ τ∗) 
        ─────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢fun fref name
```

### Generic Circuits

A reference to a generic callable object is well-formed if the referenced name maps to a callablew `κ` in the context,
the list of supplied type arguments matches the type parameters of the generic callable, and all type arguments are
well-formed.

```agda
    ⊢fun-gen
      : Fun name (𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩ .env) κ
      → Match-Param-Arg∗ (κ .params .proj₁) targ∗
      → All (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ⊢targ_) targ∗ 
        ─────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢fun fref1 name targ∗ 
```

### Anonymous Circuits

An anonymous circuit declaration is well-formed if the arguments it binds (given by the list `arg∗`) are all
well-formed, the declared return type `type` is well-formed, and the body of the circuit is well-formed with respect to
the surrounding context `Γ` extended with the arguments bound by the circuit declaration.

```agda
    ⊢fun-circuit
      : (ψ∗ : List (PatArg η⟨ Γ ⟩))
      → (τ  : ⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ )
      → (𝓢 : ⊢Stmt (bindPats Γ ψ∗ , τ) v∗ )
      → ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢fun circuit (pat-erase∗ ψ∗) (τ .ty) ↓[ 𝓢 ]stmt
```

### Function References

There are five different ways we can refer to a callable object in the context:

1. Witness declarations,
2. Circuit declarations,
3. Circuits declared in an external contract,
4. Kernel operations (e.g., `checkpoint()`), or
5. ADT operations (e.g., `Counter.increment()`).

The predicate `FRef` captures these different kinds of references to callable objects.

```agda

  data Fun (name : Name) (nv : Env Δ) (κ : Callable Δ) : Set where
    fun-witness : (name , κ) ∈ nv .witnesses →  Fun name nv κ
    fun-circuit : (name , κ) ∈ nv .circuits → Fun name nv κ
    -- todo: call to external declaration
    fun-kernel : (name , κ) ∈ nv .builtin .kernel → Fun name nv κ
    
    fun-adt-op
      : ∀ adt 
      → (name , κ , refl) ∈ nv .builtin .adt-ops (name , κ .params .proj₁) adt
      → ∃[ targs ] ∃[ m ] (name′ , _ , is-adt-ref {targ∗ = targ∗} adt m targs) ∈ nv .ledger
      → Fun name nv κ
```

```agda
  κ⟨_⟩ : Γ ⊢fun fun → Callable Δ⟨ Γ ⟩
  κ⟨ fn ⟩ = getc-subst fn .proj₁


  σ⟨_⟩ : (fn : Γ ⊢fun fun) → SubstitutionT [ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ v↦ κ⟨ fn ⟩ .params .proj₁ ] (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ .variables)
  σ⟨ fn ⟩ = getc-subst fn .proj₂ 

  returnT : (_ : ⊢Fun Γ) → ⊢Type (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) 
  returnT fn = ⋊[ σ⟨ fn .⊢Fun.well-formed-function ⟩ ] (κ⟨ fn .⊢Fun.well-formed-function  ⟩ .returns) 

  inst : (fn : Γ ⊢fun fun) → _ 
  inst fn = ⋊[ σ⟨ fn  ⟩ ]

  argsT : (_ : ⊢Fun Γ) → List (⊢Type Δ⟨ Γ ⟩)
  argsT fn = lmap (inst (fn .⊢Fun.well-formed-function )) $ κ⟨ fn .⊢Fun.well-formed-function  ⟩ .args 
```

### Argument Manipulation

When defining well-formedness of language constructs that interact with callables, we often need to mediate between
matching listst of parameters and arguments. To aid this, we define several auxiliary functions.

First, the `fetch-param` allows us to retrieve the matching type argument for a given type parameter from a list of
matching arguments.

```agda
  fetch-param
    : ∀ type-param
    → type-param ∈ type-param∗
    → Match-Param-Arg∗ type-param∗ targ∗
    → ∃[ targ ] targ ∈ targ∗
  fetch-param
    {type-param∗ = nat-valued _ ∷ _} {targ∗ = targ-size _ ∷ _}
    type-param (here refl) (tt ∷ m)
    = _ , here refl
  fetch-param
    {type-param∗ = type-valued _ ∷ _} {targ∗ = targ-type _ ∷ _}
    type-param (here refl) (tt ∷ m)
    = _ , here refl
  fetch-param
    type-param (there px) (x∼y ∷ m)
    with fetch-param _ px m
  ... | targ , px′ = targ , there px′
```

Next, we have the following proofs that if we know that a type parameter is `nat-valued` or `type-valued`, the
corresponding type argument in a matching list of arguments will have the right shape, in that it is a quoted natural
number if the parameter is `nat-valued`
and a type if it is `type-valued`.

```agda
  fetch-kind-♯
    : (x : nat-valued name ∈ type-param∗)
    → (m : Match-Param-Arg∗ type-param∗ targ∗)
    → ∃[ n ] fetch-param (nat-valued name) x m .proj₁ ≡ targ-size n  
  fetch-kind-♯ (here refl) (_∷_ {y = targ-size n} tt _)
    = n , refl
  fetch-kind-♯ (there px) (_ ∷ m)
    = fetch-kind-♯ px m
    
  fetch-kind-★
    : (x : type-valued name ∈ type-param∗)
    → (m : Match-Param-Arg∗ type-param∗ targ∗)
    → ∃[ type ] fetch-param (type-valued name) x m .proj₁ ≡ targ-type type 
  fetch-kind-★ (here refl) (_∷_ {y = targ-type t} tt _)
    = t , refl
  fetch-kind-★ (there px) (_ ∷ m)
    = fetch-kind-★ px m
```

Then, the following function retrieves a list of applied type arguments from a function-like object.

```agda
  get-targ∗
    : (fun : Function)
    → List Type-Argument
  get-targ∗ (fref _)
    = []
  get-targ∗ (fref1 _ targ∗)
    = targ∗
  get-targ∗ (circuit _ _ _)
    = []
```

Finally, the `getc-subst` function takes a well-formedness proof for a function-like object, and returns the
corresponding callable object, together with a type-level substitution that captures the instantiation of type variables
bound by the function object.

This substitution is necessary to describe, e.g., well-formedness of function calls. For example, when calling a generic
circuit, the type of the whole expression is the return type of the circuit. But since any generic type variables bound
by the circuit can be referenced in its return type, we must apply a substitution first that instantiates the free
occurcences of the type parameters of the circuit with the type argument instantiation for these parameters at that
particular call-site.

```agda
  convert
    : (x : type-param ∈ type-param∗)
    → (m : Match-Param-Arg∗ type-param∗ targ∗)
    → Δ ⊢targ fetch-param type-param x m .proj₁
    → param[ (λ _ → ∃[ size ] Δ ⊢tsize size)
           , (λ _ → ∃[ type ] Δ ⊢type  type)
           ] type-param 
  convert {nat-valued x₁} x m
    with fetch-kind-♯ x m
  ... | n , eq rewrite eq
    = λ where (⊢targ-size m) → (type-size n) , ⊢tsize-quote′ n
  convert {type-valued x₁} x m
    with fetch-kind-★ x m
  ... | type , eq rewrite eq =
    λ where
    (⊢targ-type wf) → type , wf

  getc-subst
    : (wf : Γ ⊢fun fun)
    → Σ[ κ ∈ Callable Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ] SubstitutionT [ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ v↦ κ .params .proj₁ ] (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ .variables)
  getc-subst (⊢fun-mono {τ = τ} {τ∗ = τ∗} _)
    = callable ([] , λ _ ()) τ τ∗ , λ ()
  getc-subst (⊢fun-gen {κ = κ} _ m wf)
    = κ , λ where
            {param} x →
               convert x m (Data.List.Relation.Unary.All.lookup wf (fetch-param _ x m .proj₂) )
  
  getc-subst (⊢fun-circuit ψ∗ τ wf)
    = callable ([] , λ _ () ) τ(pat→type∗ ψ∗) , λ() 
```

## Module Definitions

Module definitions are well-formed with respect to input and output contexts `Γ` and `Γ′`.

** TODO: modules should collect only the names exported by the program elements within. Currently, no declared names are
visible **

```agda
  data _⊢mdefn_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Module-Definition
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
```

A module definition is well-formed if all declared type parameters are well-formed, and the body of the module is a
well-formed sequence of program elements w.r.t. the surrounding context `Γ` extended with type variables bound in the
module header.

**TODO: how should the boolean flag `b` affect the semantics`?**
**TODO: bind module in context?**

```agda
    ⊢mdefn
      : All (Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ⊢type-param_) type-param∗
      → Sequence _⊢pelt_⊣_ pelt∗ ((type-param∗ ⋊ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) , weaken-context 𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩) Γ′ 
        ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢mdefn module′ b name type-param∗ pelt∗ ⊣ Γ′
```

## Includes

**TODO: what is the difference between an include and import statement?**
**TODO: what (if any?) declarations does this bring into scope?**

```agda
  data _⊢incld_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Include
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
    
    ⊢incld
      : ─────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢incld include name ⊣ Γ
    
```

## Export Declarations

Export declarations mark a list of names for export. Since we don't model named imports/exports yet, its well-formedness
is trivial.

```agda
  data _⊢xdecl_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Export-Declaration
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
    
    ⊢xdecl
      : ─────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢xdecl export name∗ ⊣ Γ
```

## External Declarations

**TODO: the declared name should be added to the context**

```agda
  data _⊢edecl_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : External-Declaration
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
```

An extenrnal circuit declaration is well-formed if

* all type parameters are well-formed,
* all arguments are well-formed, and
* the declared return type is well-formed.

```
    ⊢edecl-external
      : All (Δ ⊢type-param_) type-param∗
      → All (λ arg → Δ ⊢arg arg) arg∗
      → Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ⊢type type
        ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢edecl external b name type-param∗ arg∗ type ⊣ Γ
```

## Circuit Definitions

**TODO: this does not model purity check yet. **

```agda
  data _⊢cdefn_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Circuit-Definition
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
```

A circuit definition is well-formed if

* all type parameters are well-formed (`wf₁`),

* the return type is well-formed under the type context extended with the circuit's type parameters (`wf₂`),

* the arguments are well-formed under the type context extended with the circuit's type parameters (`wf₃`), and

* the circuit's body is a well-formed statement (`wf₄`).

```agda
    ⊢cdefn
      : ( wf₁ : ∀ type-param → type-param ∈ type-param∗
                             → Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ⊢type-param type-param )
      → ( τ : ⊢Type (type-param∗ ⋊ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩))
      → ( ψ∗ : List (PatArg η⟨ wk type-param∗ Γ ⟩) )
      → ( wf₄ : (bindPats (wk _ Γ) ψ∗ , τ) ⊢stmt stmt ⊣ v∗ ) 
      → let ω = callable (-, wf₁) τ (pat→type∗ ψ∗) in
        --  ^ bundles well-formedness proofs for the type parameters,
        --    arguments, and return types into a callable.
        ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
        Γ ⊢cdefn circuit b₁ b₂ name type-param∗ (pat-erase∗ ψ∗) type stmt
               ⊣ (-, bindCircuit (name , ω) 𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩)     
```

A callable corresponding to the defined circuit is bound in the output context.

## Witness Declarations

```agda
  data _⊢wdecl_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Witness-Declaration
    → Context
    → Set where
```

A witness declaration is well-formed if

* all type parameters are well-formed (`wf₁`),

* the return type is well-formed under the type context extended with the circuit's type parameters (`wf₂`),

* the arguments are well-formed under the type context extended with the circuit's type parameters (`wf₃`), and

```agda
    ⊢wdecl-witness
      : ( wf₁ : ∀ type-param → type-param ∈ type-param∗
                             → Δ⟨ Γ ⟩ ⊢type-param type-param )
      → ( wf₂ : (type-param∗ ⋊ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) ⊢type type)
      → ( wf₃ : All ((type-param∗ ⋊ Δ⟨ Γ ⟩) ⊢arg_) arg∗ ) 
      → let w = callable (-, wf₁) (mkTy _ wf₂) (arg→type∗ wf₃) in
        --  ^ bundles well-formedness proofs for the type parameters,
        --    arguments, and return types into a callable.
        ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢wdecl witness b name type-param∗ arg∗ type
               ⊣ (-, bindWitness (name , w) 𝓒⟨ Γ ⟩)
```

## External Contract Declarations

```agda
  data _⊢ecdecl_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : External-Contract-Declaration
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
```

An external contract declaration is well-formed if the stored list of external circuit declarations, `ecdecl-circuit*`
is a well-formed sequence of program elements.

**TOTO: the declared name should be bound in the output context. **

```agda 
    ⊢ecdecl
      : Sequence _⊢edecl-circuit_⊣_ ecdecl-circuit∗ Γ Γ′
        ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢ecdecl external-contract b name ecdecl-circuit∗ ⊣ Γ′
```

## Enum Definitions

**TODO: conditions on the names, e.g., no shadowing or duplicates? **

```agda
  data _⊢enumdef_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Enum-Definition
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
```

An enum definition is trivially well-formed (as we don't impoose any restrictions on names yet). The declared
enumeration is bound in the output context.

```agda  
    ⊢enumdef
      : ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢enumdef enum b name name₁ name∗ ⊣ defineEnum name name∗ Γ
```

## Program Elements

Program elements are the top-level declarations that can occur in compact programs. They can be

* an include statement,
* a module definition,
* an import declaration,
* an export declaration,
* a ledger declaration,
* a ledger constructor,
* a circuit definition,
* an external declaration,
* a witness declaration,
* an external circuit declaration,
* a structure definition, or
* an enumeration definition.

Well-formedness of program elements is defined by referring to the corresponding judgment for that element.

```agda
  data _⊢pelt_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Program-Element
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
    
    ⊢pelt-incld
      : Γ ⊢incld incld ⊣ Γ′
        ─────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢pelt `incld incld ⊣ Γ′

    ⊢pelt-ecdecl

        ─────────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢pelt `structdef structdef ⊣ Γ′
        
    ⊢pelt-enumdef
      : Γ ⊢enumdef enumdef ⊣ Γ′
        ─────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢pelt `enumdef enumdef ⊣ Γ′ 
```

## Programs

Programs (i.e., a sequence of program elements) are well-formed w.r.t. a before and after context, the latter
representing definitions that have been added to the program.

```agda
  data _⊢p_⊣_ (Γ : Context)
    : Program
    → (Γ′ : Context)
    → Set where
```

A program is well-formed if we have a well-formed sequence of program elements, with matching in- and output contexts
`Γ` and `Γ′`.

```
    ⊢p-program
      : Sequence _⊢pelt_⊣_ pelt∗ Γ Γ′ 
        ─────────────────────────────
        Γ ⊢p program pelt∗ ⊣ Γ′
```

# Enforcing Coverage

As a sanity check, we enforce the typing relation to be syntax-directed, meaning that there should be a one-to-one
correspondence between the untyped syntax of `Lsrc` and its typing rules. This is to force synchronization between the
static semantic specification and internal syntax of the compiler. We identify three meaningful ways in which the syntax
can change that would require the static semantic specification to be updated.

1. new syntax is added to the language,

2. existing syntax is deleted from the language, or

3. existing syntax is changed (i.e., constructor arguments are added, removed, changed, or re-ordered).

Changes (2) and (3) will automatically prompt any corresponding typing rules to become ill-typed, so they are easily
caught by re-checking the specification once the language is updated. Catching missing rules is more tricky, as Agda's
type checker will take no offence if a relation does not cover all possible constructors of it's index type. To still
force a static error if one of the typing rules is missing, we make use of Agda's reflection to manually check that all
syntax of the language is covered.

To force coverage of a (collection of) typing relation (s) is a two-step process.

1. First we must collect all judgments and "register" them as being a mutually-defined family of judgments that defines
   typing for a langauge (in this case `Lsrc`).

2. Then, we run a meta-program to check that this family of judments covers all syntax in the language. This program
   fails if one or more rules are missing, pointing for each incomplete relation for which constructors in the untyped
   syntax it was unable to locate a corresponding typing rule.

## Register Typing Relations

To register a typing relation for the `Lsrc` language, we define an instance of the `HasTyping` class. This requires us
to provide a judgment relation for each syntactic sort in the language. If we fail to supply a judgment for one or more
syntactic sorts this manifests as a type error.

```agda 
instance lsrc-typing : HasTyping Lsrc
lsrc-typing .rels =
    inj₂ (-, (-, _⊢parg_⦂_)) 
  ∷ inj₁ (-, _⊢arg_)
  ∷ inj₁ (-, _⊢import-name_)
  ∷ inj₁ (-, _⊢type_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢new-field_⦂_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢lconstructor_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢edecl_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢wdecl_⊣_) 
  ∷ inj₁ (-, _⊢tsize_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢expr_⦂_) 
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢p_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, (-, _⊢pat_⦂_))
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢edecl-circuit_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢stmt_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢structdef_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢pelt_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢ldecl_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢idecl_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₁ (-, _⊢targ_)
  ∷ inj₁ (-, _⊢fun_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢mdefn_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢incld_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₁ (-, _⊢type-param_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢xdecl_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₁ (-, _⊢tref_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢cdefn_⊣_)
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢ecdecl_⊣_ )
  ∷ inj₂ (-, -, _⊢enumdef_⊣_)
  ∷ []

```

## Coverage check

Finally, we invoke the `checkRels` meta-program (defined in
`Coverage.agda`) to check that the registered typing relation for the Lsrc syntax actually covers all syntactic elements
in the language.

This means that if there is a constructor in one of the data types of
`Lsrc` for which there is no typing rule in the corresponding judgment, a type error is thrown that indicates that a
rule seems to be missing. If more than one constructor of the `Lsrc` language is not covered, the meta program points
out all constructors for which a typing rule is missing.

```agda 
-- Performs a check that the typing relations registered above are covering
-- for the Lsrc syntax tree 
unquoteDecl
 = checkRels (getTyping Lsrc) []
```

For instance, if we comment out some typing rules in this file and attempt to type-check it, we might get an error like
this:

```text

  Discovered missing rule(s) while checking coverage of relation _⊢lconstructor_⊣_
    ---> No typing rule found for constructor constructor′
  
  Discovered missing rule(s) while checking coverage of relation _⊢expr_⦂_
    ---> No typing rule found for constructor >
    ---> No typing rule found for constructor >=
  
  Discovered missing rule(s) while checking coverage of relation _⊢stmt_⊣_
    ---> No typing rule found for constructor +=
    ---> No typing rule found for constructor -=
```
